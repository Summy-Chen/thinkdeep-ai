      "summary": "Dear MLEs - I am very curious about how recommendation systems of most dating apps like Tinder, Bumble etc. work.. I’ll be very grateful for some feedback on my understanding, especially if you’ve worked on something similar 🙏 TL:DR Dating apps have two goals: a) Retain attractive profiles b) monetize low/mid profiles If you are a free user, you see profiles ranked by Prob (you would swipe right) If you are attractive, this leads to some success.

      "summary": "I think Turing goes much further in his work than the current state of data-driven models really allows. But still I'm curious; what is your view on this discussion (Lovelace vs. Turing; argument 6 in his paper) about whether machines can really produce something new especially if you think about the current generative Al models? Is the point of &quot;never do anything really new&quot; basically the core of the imitation game, or do you think machines will be capable of doing something new? But ...",
